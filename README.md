*Below is what I observed based on the role give by my team duirng the talk..*
How you started business..
   To start a business, Encik Nik Mohd Habibullah said we need to know what kind of things we want to sell, it can be services, product or any other type of business. Then, we need to look out for the market size. He said the market size can be big or small depends on the clients demands. For instance, the getmehired.io is a large-scale market size because of the collaboration between the company and universities. Then, we need to know what kind of technologies to use to meet the demand. This is crucial because we want to match what the client wants based on the description they gave. He also said networks between other companies and the timeline to develop as well as producing the product or service are one of the important things to take note. Beside networks and timeline, the sustainability of the product or services are also important. Not only that, he also mentions to know the financial status and the risk of develop the product or service. On top of that, he elaborate on the business application flow. He stated IRPA Method is the best way to describe a business flow. The IRPA method stands for Identify, Research, Prepare and Apply.

Reflection
    In order for me to be successful in computer science for the next four years, I need to concentrate and focused more on the foundation of computer languages. This mainly because I have a higher chance to get hired by a company based on the skills I honed. I also need to take part in projects, internships, and coding exercises to enhances my soft skills. I also need to keep updated in technology and participate actively in communities and professional networks. Last but not least, I must focus solely on my goals and need to be committed and flexible on my work in achieving the goal.
